-- ds.page: Updating sitemap links

To navigate between pages you need to keep updating the sitemap of your `ds`. In `ds`
we have added a sitemap into the `FASTN.ftd` file.

Each new file you create if you want to add it to the main menu(Top navigation) then 
use below code sample.

Let's say you have created a new `about-me.ftd` file into the `<root>` folder of your
FTD web project then add it into the `fastn.sitemap` component.

Add the below line into the `FASTN.ftd` folder. Ensure `-- fastn.sitemap:` should be called 
only one time.

-- cb.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

# About me: /about-me/

-- ds.h2: Accessing a folder into sitemap:

If you have created a folder for your blog posts named `blog` into the `<root>`
folder of your project like `<your-ftd-project>/blog/` and added a `first-post.ftd`
file into it.

Each folder you create, we recommend adding an `index.ftd` file into it, to access 
folder into `fastn.sitemap` by default.

Adding your `blog` folder into `fastn.sitemap` inside `FASTN.ftd` file:

-- cb.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

# About me: /about-me/

# Blog: /blog/

- Blog posts:
  - My First Post: /blog/first-post/

-- ds.h2: `TOC` into page using sitemap

You can use `fastn.sitemap` for table of contents also. To create TOC of your `ds`
into `FASTN.ftd` using sitemap follow below given pattern. 

Showing example of our `Documentation` page TOC:

-- cb.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: index.html

# About me: /about-me/

# Documentation: /docs/

- Documentation:
  - Using `ds.page`: /docs/page/
  - Updating `FASTN.ftd` sitemap links: /docs/sitemap/
  - Updating your resume: /docs/resume/
  - Using typography: /docs/typography/
  - Updating Footer info: /docs/footer/

-- tf.markdown:

Output of above, see below toc of our documentation page. TOC appears above 
footer of your `ds`.
